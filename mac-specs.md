## Get a Mac

All students must bring their own MacBook laptop. Your MacBook should have a minimum of 4GB of RAM and 128GB of hard drive space. Those are minimum specs, but I *REALLY* recommend getting 8GB or more of RAM.

Here are the current [MacBook Air models](http://www.apple.com/macbook-air/specs.html) and [MacBook Pro models](http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs-retina/).

Your MacBook MUST be running OS X Yosemite or El Capitan. Both are free upgrades from the App Store.

Do not go with the new, skinny 12‚Äù MacBooks. Their processor will be too sluggish in a year or two.

There is no commercial software required for the class.
