## Welcome!

Welcome to the The Iron Yard in Durham! Congratulations on being accepted and for deciding to take on such an intense program. The next three months will be exciting, exhausting, and empowering.

Here you'll find references and resources for you to use before, during, and after the class.


### Before

You'll need to complete all of these steps by September 5th. This timing is both so that I can review and so that you can rest before class starts.
