# Pre-work

We've got [a lot to cover](https://dgosxlrnzhofi.cloudfront.net/custom_page_images/64/page_images/Rails_Competencies.png?1386276348) and only a few short weeks to do so. I'm going to ask that you complete some preliminary work, so that we can establish a common starting point and spend class time focusing on things that are most difficult to learn on your own.

This pre-work won't make you a Ruby master but it will make sure that you've got a good foundation to build on and are ready to make the most out of the course.d

Importantly, this work will assure me that you:

* can self-direct progress on technical projects.
* have been exposed to the key technologies and workflows that we'll be using in class.
* can communicate difficulties and accomplishments clearly.
* have reflected on your learning style.

Additionally, I will expect you to at least be _familiar_ with running programs from the Terminal e.g. `git` and `irb` from having done this pre-work. If you hadn't tried these things before the first day of class you'd likely be lost quickly as we hit the ground running.


## Giving And Receiving Help

One of the hardest skills for a junior dev to learn is how to ask for help. It is also one of the most important. I, of course, am here to help however I can. But you will also need to lean on the class and community around you.

* Watch (and re-watch if necessary) this excellent video: [Your Brain's API: Giving and Getting Technical Help](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY14Er6JX2s)


## Requirements

Review and complete the tasks below by **Sept 5th**. Any deliverables need to be emailed to me by then. If you have any questions, please email - I'll be glad to help (though expect some good-natured shaming if you're pushing the deadline).

You will need to sign up for Treehouse to complete some of these tasks. Treehouse is free for 14 days (which is enough to finish the required work), and $25/month after the trial.


## Setup

### Install software

Follow the [installation instructions here to setup your mac](/before/mac-setup) if you haven't already.

### Install a text editor

As a developer, you spend most of your time reading, writing, and editing code, so it's no surprise that a text editor is one the most important tools to familiarize yourself with. I would recommend one of the following:

* Atom - Pro: free. Con: can be sluggish, especially to open.
* Sublime Text 3 - Pro: fully featured, very snappy, excellent package ecosystem. Con: non-free (nagware).
* Ruby Mine - Pro: integrated Ruby-aware features (code completion, method lookups). Con: non-free, heavyweight.
* Vim - Pro: powerful modal editor, works in a terminal, ubiquitous. Con: steep learning curve.

I use Atom and Vim myself and have used Sublime Text in the past, but won't be requiring it (learning Vim can distract too much from learning to code) - though you will likely see both Vim and Atom in lectures. Regardless of which editor you decide to use, spend some time familiarizing yourself with it (customizing and learning shortcuts, for instance). Mastering the tools you use every day will always pay dividends.


## The Command Line

The command line will be our primary interface to the computer, and aside from your editor, the place you will spend the most time. If you've never opened up a terminal before, now is the time to start getting comfortable.

* (Optional, but recommended) Install and use iTerm2 as your terminal
* Read [About the Command Line](http://skillcrush.com/2012/12/03/command-line-2/)
* Go through the Treehouse course on [Getting Started with the Console](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/console-foundations#getting-started-with-the-console)
* Go through the Treehouse course on [Users and Permissions](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/console-foundations#users-and-permissions)
* Go through the Treehouse course on [Environment and Redirection](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/programming/console-foundations#environment-and-redirection)
* Read and practice with [A Command Line Primer for Beginners](http://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-line-for-almost-anything)


## Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Developers use such tools both to track their own work as it changes over time, and to collaborate with other developers on larger projects. I use Git on _every_ non-trivial project I work on, and this class will be no different.

Again, the objective is not to become an expert before the class, but just to start to get comfortable with the concepts and vocabulary. We'll continue to work with Git throughout the course and cover some of the more advanced concerns in class.

* Go through the Treehouse course on [Git Basics](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/git-basics).
* If you want to spend some more time with git, [Git immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) is a great resource.


## GitHub

GitHub is a website which hosts Git repositories. We will be hosting all of our class projects on GitHub, and it will likely be the center of your open-source world for some time to come. In many circles, your GitHub profile _is_ your resume, and it needs to be created with that in mind:

* [Sign up for a GitHub account](https://github.com/) - something professional, if not exactly your name.
* Make sure to add a profile picture and your full name.
* Check out the [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) if you want to learn how to use GitHub prior to class.


## HTML / CSS

At the end of the day, many of our applications will be responsible for producing HTML and CSS. That said, we will be covering them rapidly, as many people are familiar with them from past experience. Especially if you are not, you must take some time to familiarize yourself with these foundational technologies.

* Complete the [Codecademy HTML & CSS course](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web)

This class is primarily concerned with data flow and functionality over design, so a little bit of extra CSS experience will really help you stand out and make your projects look significantly more polished.


## Ruby

We'll cover Ruby from square one in class, but many of the concepts can take repeated exposure before sinking in. So, you don't want your first exposure to be in lecture.

* Complete the [Codecademy Ruby course](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/ruby).
* Be sure you _understand_ at least through "Hashes and Symbols".


## Reflection

Good job! Take a step back and reflect on where you are. Did you enjoy any assignments in particular? Struggle with any? How are you feeling about the upcoming class? Excited? Nervous? How do you learn best? How can you maximize the value you get out of this course? Do you anticipate any problems? If so, how can we work to avoid them? Where do you want to be in 3 months? 12?

* Write up your reflections and send them to me via email.

We'll be encouraging this sort of reflection throughout the course - if you feel comfortable sharing publicly, this would be a good time to start a blog and post them there.

* (Optional, but recommended) [Look in to blogging on GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).


## Next Steps

If you've internalized the concepts from above, you will be ready for the first day.

While you have the Treehouse account, it would be beneficial to also:

* (Optional, but recommended) Go through the Treehouse course on [Ruby](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/learn-ruby).
* (Optional, but recommended) Go through the Treehouse course on [Rails](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/rails-development).

Many of you are coming into class with some non-trivial Ruby experience, and I'll be asking correspondingly more out of you. If you've got some Ruby or general programming background already:

* I'll expect you to help out students who aren't as familiar with coding or Ruby. I promise - teaching will pay dividends for your learning. Please start now by taking notes about resources you've used and whether or not you found them helpful.
* I'll also expect you to be more self-directed in your learning, or at least vocal when you need more of a challenge. If you have extra bandwidth early on, I'd recommend looking into a language _other_ than Ruby (lest you just stay that much farther ahead). If you can divorce general concepts from language specifics, you'll understand your fundamentals that much better. Consider exploring Javascript, and aiming to understand it in the same depth as we cover Ruby; or a low-level language like C, to understand more about exactly how the computer executes; or an alien language like Elixir, Clojure, or Haskell, to be exposed to important ideas from functional programming.

If you have no such experience, don't panic! We'll cover everything else that you really need. If you have extra time, I'd recommend getting as comfortable as possible with your system - using shortcuts, setting up your editor, using the terminal, manipulating files, etc. The sooner you feel at home there, the sooner you can focus on learning.

I'll say this many more times, but can't emphasize enough how much I mean it: I'm here to help.
