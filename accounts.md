Over the course of the class, we'll be using a number of online services. These are the ones you'll need to register for on your own. Please use the __same email address__ to register that you provided for our Iron Yard communications.

* [Github](https://github.com/) - Add a profile picture and your full name
* [Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/identity)
* [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)

You may have heard that we also use the following tools, but don't sign up for them yet; we'll do that once you get here:

* [Slack](http://slack.com)
* [Trello](http://trello.com)
